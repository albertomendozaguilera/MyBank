# MyBank
This project consisted of developing a set of applications for the presentation
of my final degree project.

In addition to developing an Android application, I implemented an architecture
based on the Spring Framework. It is made up of an API Rest in which you can access
certain services. This application communicates with a MySQL database deployed
in Amazon Web Services. Additionally there is an application in Spring MVC.
Both the Spring app containing the Rest and MVC services are deployed on Heroku.
